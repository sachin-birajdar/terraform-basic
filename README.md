# terraform-basic

njnThis repository contains all the basics needed to kick start on terraform.

Default variable file name that terraform looks for is terraform.tfvars

If you supply any file apart from terraform.tfvars , you need to specify the name of the file with -var-file=filename.tfvars

Arguments and Attributes in terraform
Arguments are the build blocks of the resources that you wish to create, which are like the properties to be used to create instance.

EX: ``` AMI to use , Security Group To Use, Network To Use``` 
Attributes are the properties which can only be see once the resource is provisioned.

Ex: ``` Instance ID, Private IP, Public IP```
Depends on the type of changes, terraform change can be either --> Concurrent --> Disruptive --> Destroy and recreate
